# The Wheel of (un)Fortunate

With only a fraction of a chance, would you survive the brainrot?

May the luck be with you ðŸ˜ˆ

## Tech stack
React (Typescript)

Tailwind CSS

Vite

GitHub Co-pilot

## Features
The app was built in less than 1 hour using bolt.new (not sponsored)

## Prompt
"i want to have a web app that spins a wheel, with 1 out of 6 slots opening and playing a Youtube video, randomly chosen from a list"

## Challenges
I need to speedrun this in less than 1 hour.

## Overcome
With AI, I don't need to fix a line of code, just tell the LLM what to do. Oh maybe I fixed a bit CSS.

## Future
Maybe automating the brainrot music fetching to play something random on Youtube rather than hardcode the links?
